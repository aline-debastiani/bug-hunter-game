🎮 Interactive QA training game built with React. Players identify real-world software bugs and learn testing concepts through gameplay.
🎮 Bug Hunter Game

An interactive web-based QA training game where players analyze real-world software scenarios, identify defects, and classify their severity.

Built to practice frontend development and apply Quality Assurance concepts in a gamified experience.

🚀 Project Goal

This project was created to:

Practice modern frontend development using React

Apply software testing knowledge in a practical context

Simulate real-world bug classification scenarios

Structure clean, maintainable, and scalable code

Prepare for international QA/Automation opportunities

🧠 How the Game Works

The player selects a mission.

Each mission presents:

Context

Evidence

A testing-related question

The player chooses the correct bug classification.

The game calculates the score.

The result screen explains the correct answer and impact.
